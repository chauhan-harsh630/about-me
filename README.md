My personal GitHub profile README — a glimpse into my coding journey and learning path.



# Hi there 👋 I’m Harsh Chauhan!

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## 🚀 About Me
I’m Harsh Chauhan, a passionate learner with a deep interest in technology, coding, and cybersecurity. Currently pursuing my BCA, I’m focused on building a strong foundation in computer science and preparing for an MCA in Cyber Security.

What started as simple curiosity — writing my first lines of code — has grown into a love for solving problems, building projects, and exploring how technology shapes our world. I enjoy both the creative side of coding, designing intuitive user interfaces, and the analytical side, ensuring systems and data are secure.

I’ve worked on projects like a News App, Weather App, To-Do List App, and a personal Portfolio Website, using JavaScript, React, Python, C/C++, and Tailwind CSS to bring ideas to life.

Beyond GitHub, I share my coding journey, progress, and tech insights on Instagram at @the_cyberpath
, posting projects, reels, and tips from what I learn along the way.

I’m always looking to grow, experiment, and contribute to the tech community — blending creativity, coding, and security in everything I build.
